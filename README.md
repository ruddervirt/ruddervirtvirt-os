# RudderVirt Virt OS

RudderVirt Virt OS is a specialized operating system that provides a secure, containerized environment for hosting virtual machines on [ruddervirt.com](https://ruddervirt.com).

**Important**: This operating system is the foundation for running a private VM Deployment Zone on ruddervirt.com. However, it cannot be connected or used without coordination with Rudder Virt. Please contact us at [selfhosted@ruddervirt.com](mailto:selfhosted@ruddervirt.com) for more information.

## Prerequisites
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/)

## Quick Start

Create a bootable installer ISO

```bash
docker run --rm -t -v "$PWD":/output ghcr.io/ruddervirt/ruddervirtvirt-os:latest /dev/DRIVEX "your-plaintext-password"
```

Replace:
- `/dev/DRIVEX` with your target installation device (e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/nvme0n1`)
- `your-plaintext-password` with the password you want set on the installed OS

The ISO will be created as `ruddervirtvirt-install.iso` in your current directory. Burn this onto a media or flash drive (we recommend [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) or [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)). Then, boot into it on your hardware, and it will automatically install. **Warning:** This will overwrite any existing data on the drive.

### Target Hardware Requirements
- **CPU**: 
  - Bare metal x86_64 processor with VT-x/AMD-V support
  - Nested virtualization is not supported
- **Memory**:
  - Minimum 128GB RAM (more recommended)
- **Storage**: 
  - Minimum 500GB (more recommended)
  - SSD required, NVME recommended 
  - External SAN can also be used in lieu of local disks
- **Network**: 
  - Gigabit or faster Ethernet connection with internet
  - 10Gbps private network for multi-node setups
